# top-of-atmosphere-reflectance
C++ code to convert satellite imagery from digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere radiance and reflectane.

###### DESCRIPTION

    This C++ code takes converts a satellite imagery from a satellite (e.g. WorldView 1, WorldView2, 
    WorldView3, GeoEye 1, Quickbird 2), and converts its pixel values from Digital Numbers (DN) to 
    both top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance as well as top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. To this end,
    this program will expect command-line inputs for (1) the name of the image file (.NTF,.NITF), as well
    as the corresponding XML (.XML,.xml) and .IMD metadata files.
